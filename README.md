# About Me

I am currently studying **Full Stack Web Development** at the **University of Alberta**. Iâ€™m expanding my knowledge of both front-end and back-end technologies.

In my spare time, I enjoy experimenting with coding projects, such as a basic **C# calculator app**. I also explore development tools like **JetBrains Rider** and **Visual Studio 2022**.

I have experience with **C#** and I am interested in tech start-up stories.
