# About Me

I am currently studying Full Stack Web Development at the University of Alberta, where I am learning front-end technologies and Git.

I have basic experience with C# syntax, including creating a C# calculator app using IDEs like JetBrains Rider and Visual Studio 2022.

My first programming language is C#, and I am interested in tech start-up stories.
